Before transitioning into the data science domain, I worked as an Analyst at HCL Technologies from 2021 to 2023. In this role, I significantly improved operational efficiency by streamlining Microsoft 365 account management, leading to a 90% increase in account handling efficiency. I optimized email workflows and monitored system health through ServiceNow, which helped ensure 80% service availability. I also designed and delivered training materials that enabled 95% of the support team to get up to speed within 30 days—improving the consistency and quality of support.

Prior to that, I worked as a Junior Software Engineer at Igon Soft Solutions from 2019 to 2021, where I focused on responsive web development using HTML/CSS and managed MySQL databases with 99.9% uptime. I enhanced system performance through query optimization and routine maintenance, and resolved over 50 technical issues, ensuring high system reliability and improving the overall development workflow.

These experiences helped me build a strong foundation in problem-solving, system optimization, and data handling—skills that I now bring into my work as a Data Analyst. My goal is to use data-driven insights to help businesses improve operations and make informed decisions.
